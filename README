Some experiments with "Broken Sword: Director's Cut"

Enjoying a lot when I'm able to play adventure games with scummvm, I was
disapointed to see that I couldn't run my newly-bought adventure game with it.
So I started poking around in the files to see if I can get something out.
Those scripts are the results of this poking.

In case it can be of use for someone willing to continue (well, start) the
scummvm port, I publish them:
- extract.py: extract content from .dat files from this game.
- dump.py: to be run on some files from bs1dc.dat (images in various formats)
  to get some details on their content, and - if pygame is installed - view the
  image.
  Beware: there are non-image files in that archive, and this script won't read
  them (yet ?).

The goal of these scripts is just to document file format in a practical way,
allowing further inspection of individual contained objects.

extract.py happens to work also on *.dat files from
"Broken Sword II - The Smoking Mirror Directors Cut", but it seems content is
in yet another format (*.vim files, which seem compressed - though not zlib).
